# Applied-Plotting

This repository contains projects I have worked on that demonstrate my ability to process and display data in meaningful ways. Alberto Cairo's book, _The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication_, says that good data visualizations should be truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening. The projects in this repository encompass these qualities.


The first project involved processing some sort of sports/athletic data from your hometown and displaying it. This is the final visualization produced.

# Applied-Plotting

This repository contains projects I have worked on that demonstrate my ability to process and display data in meaningful ways. Alberto Cairo's book, _The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication_, says that good data visualizations should be truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening. The projects in this repository encompass these qualities.
